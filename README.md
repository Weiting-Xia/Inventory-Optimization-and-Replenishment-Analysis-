## 1️⃣ Evaluate Current Inventory Management
All datasets on fuel levels, tanks, locations, and invoices were cleaned and merged. Then, fuel-level trends were visualized to assess how well each station manages its inventory. The invoice data was analyzed to understand current purchasing patterns and calculate cost savings achieved through discounts.
## 2️⃣ Recommend Smarter Ordering Strategies
Using each station’s total tank capacity and average daily consumption, the analysis identified optimal order quantities and discount strategies. The goal was to minimize costs while maintaining sufficient inventory. Specific recommendations and estimated savings were provided for each location.
## 3️⃣ Identify the Best Day to Place Orders
Fuel price data was analyzed by day of the week to find which day historically offered the lowest prices. Additional savings were calculated if purchases were consistently made on that day.
## 4️⃣ Evaluate the Feasibility of Adding Tanks
Assuming the cost of adding new tanks and the average inflation rate, a five-year cost-benefit analysis was conducted to determine which locations would gain the most from increasing tank capacity.
